Ofdmtest reads in a text file and creates an iq wave file with fs  = 100khz  and 256 char text message.
this iq wav file can be loaded into gnuradio for tx using a hackrf, bladerf or trx duo or red pitaya

ofdmrx reads in a iq wave file and decodes the ofdm signal and displays the text data.

thanks for stopping by  and start sdr experiments today
